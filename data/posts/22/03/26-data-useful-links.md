# Useful Links

Most blog posts of mine is just blabbing about coding while coding. It may be not that interesting to most of you. I totally get it, and it's fine.

However, there are some actually useful pieces, that I eventually return to and re-read. I even link to these pieces in new blog posts. 

I've listed references to these useful blog posts below. One day, they'll be a part of the official documentation.

## Creating JS Controller

**Note**. I walked through creating a JS controller while [working on facets](17-data-option-and-faceted-attribute-combo-works.md#adding-facet-option-js-behavior). Check this piece for step-by-step guide.

## JS Controller Options

**Note**. I introduced the good practice of documenting the options a JS controller expects to receive from the HTML markup [while developing the field control behavior](23-data-field-control-behavior.md#controller-options).

## URL Filter Syntax

**Note**. If you wonder what the URL parameters mean, and why they are written this way, check [the blog post on filter URL syntax](../01/10-data-filters.md#filter-syntax).

## URL Action Syntax

**Note**. URL action syntax (`-`, `-color`, `-color=red`, `color=red` and `+color=red`) is introduced while implementing [facet rendering](16-data-rendering-facets-and-applying-filters.md#action-syntax).
