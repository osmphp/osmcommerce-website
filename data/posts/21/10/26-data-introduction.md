# Introduction

I'm super-excited to announce that I'm starting a new project codenamed "The Big Red Button". It's about defining application data structures and logic in PHP code, pressing *the big red button* (hence the codename), and getting fully functioning Admin Panel and API.

### meta.abstract

I'm super-excited to announce that I'm starting a new project codenamed "The Big Red Button". It's about defining application data structures and logic in PHP code, pressing *the big red button* (hence the codename), and getting fully functioning Admin Panel and API.

## Pros

Unlike similar projects, mine will have:

* multiple record editing
* full-text faceted search
* support for database, search index, in-memory, file and other external data sources
* unprecedented level of extensibility guaranteed by [Osm Framework](https://osm.software/docs/framework/index.html)

To be honest, it's not the first time I'm trying to implement it, hopefully this time I'll learn from my mistakes and get it right. Two previous attempts failed mainly because of introducing unnecessary complexity, and the lack of the whole picture. 

## Usage

Project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/osmphp/data) will later be used as a drop-in package into any data-intensive application.

## Follow! 

I'll share the project's ideas, successes, failures, and bi-weekly status reports on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/v_osmianski), on [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/osmianski), an in the [blog](https://osm.software/blog/data/), so follow me and stay tuned!
