I had two very productive weeks. [#buildinpublic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23buildinpublic) works wonders. 

Most effort went into my new project, [Osm Admin](https://osm.software/blog/data/). I sketched how data classes look like, generated database tables from class attributes, and started working on the Admin UI. It's very fulfilling to see how an abstract idea gains shape.

I had two very productive weeks. *#buildinpublic* works wonders.

Most effort went into my new project, *Osm Admin*. I sketched how data classes look like, generated database tables from class attributes, and started working on the Admin UI. It's very fulfilling to see how an abstract idea gains shape.

## Osm Admin v0.1.0

### Introduction

It's a package for defining data structures using PHP 8 classes and attributes, and getting fully functioning Admin Panel and API. 

Here is how it's going to work.

First, define *data classes* - regular PHP classes with attributes specifying how instances of these classes are stored in database tables, and displayed in *grids* and *forms* of the admin area of your application. For example:

    /**
     * @property string $sku #[
     *      Serialized,
     *      Table\String_(unique: true),
     *      Grid\String_('SKU'),
     *      Form\String_(10, 'SKU'),
     * ]
     * @property string $description #[
     *      Serialized,
     *      Grid\String_('Description'),
     *      Form\String_(20, 'Description'),
     * ]
     */
    #[
        Table('products'), 
        Scoped, 
        Grid\Page('/products', 'Products', select: ['id', 'sku', 'description']),
        Form('/products', title_create: 'New Product', title_edit: ":title - Product"),
    ]
    class Product extends Object_
    {
        use Id, Type;
    }  

Then, generate database tables from the `#[Table\*]` attributes using a command:

    osm generate:schema

Finally, open the admin area of your application, and manage the application data using grids and forms automatically created from `#[Grid\*]` and `#[Form\]` attributes, respectively.  

### E-commerce Sample Application

In order to test this attribute-based data management engine, I simultaneously develop a sample e-commerce application. So far, it has modules for user, product and sales order management, but surely, there is more to come.

### What's Done So Far

I document daily progress on this project, challenges I face, and ideas I have, in the [blog](https://osm.software/blog/data/), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/v_osmianski), on [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/osmianski/history), and on [Projectium](https://projectium.network/project/the-big-red-button/community). If you are interested in this project, please follow and participate.

* [Concepts](../10/27-data-concepts.md)

* [Migrations](02-data-migrations.md)
* [Reusable Properties](03-data-class-traits.md)
* [Subclasses](04-data-subclasses.md)   

I started generating the Admin UI, but it's really too raw yet.

## Osm Framework v0.13.13

[Diff](https://github.com/osmphp/framework/compare/v0.13.4...v0.13.13)

What's new in this minor update:

* Customize new [default page title settings](https://osm.software/docs/framework/getting-started/configuration.html#application-title).
* Use new `_admin__tailwind` theme as a base admin area theme.
* Use new `$osm_app->area_url` instead of `$osm_app->base_url` for generating URLs in the current area.
* Register routes with parameters in a dynamic trait, see [`HttpModuleTrait`](https://github.com/osmphp/admin/blob/HEAD/src/Grids/Traits/HttpModuleTrait.php) and [`Routes`](https://github.com/osmphp/admin/blob/HEAD/src/Grids/Routes.php) in the Osm Admin project for more details. 

## *osm.software* Website v0.4.2

[Diff](https://github.com/osmphp/osmsoftware-website/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2)

In this new minor update, I've added Osm Admin to the home page, and reorganized all the blocks on the home page. I've also blogged about [Osm Admin development](#what-s-done-so-far).

## Osm Core v0.10.4

[Diff](https://github.com/osmphp/core/compare/v0.10.1...v0.10.4)

This minor update contains:

* New `AttributeRequired` exception. Throw it if you expect a class or a property to have certain PHP attribute applied.
* New `module_class_name` reflection property. It specifies the module that introduced a given class or property.
