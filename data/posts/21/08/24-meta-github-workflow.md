This article describes how we use GitHub issues and projects, both for new development and for support.

## Workflow

1. Open an issue in the most relevant repository. See all the issues you created in [Account -> Issues -> Created](https://github.com/issues). See all the issues by [applying a filter in Account -> Issues](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Aosmphp).

2. Fully understand the issue, reproduce it, resolve it by non-programming means. Decide whether you will eventually resolve it: if so, assign a project, if not, close the issue. In any case, assign a label. See all the issues without a project assigned by [applying a filter in Account -> Issues](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Aosmphp+no%3Aproject).

3. Review "To do" issues in projects. Prioritize them, move them to additional columns, or even stash them in additional projects.

4. Work on issues. Move them to "In progress" column, assign them to yourself, and assign a milestone. Use a label to communicate that the issue resolution is "waiting" for an external action. See all assigned issues in [Account -> Issues -> Assigned](https://github.com/issues/assigned).

5. Close issues. Un-assign yourself. After releasing a milestone, archive the completed issues in projects.
